This is Yiqun Jin’s crazy story.
Once upon a time, there is a crazy tree in my hometown. People called it “Huai” in Chinese. In the northern part of China, there is no possibility of growing orange, so the “Huai” in northern part could not produce orange and therefore be abandoned.That's all.

Or so we thought. As luck would have it, this special tree may not have been able to produce oranges, but it was able to grow something far more valuable. The "Haui" tree was able to grow QQ's from its branches- white rice, fried rice and lo mein. It had enough QQ's to end world hunger.
