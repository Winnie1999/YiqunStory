This is Yiqun Jin’s crazy story.
Once upon a time, there is a crazy tree in my hometown. People called it “Huai” in Chinese. In the northern part of China, there is no possibility of growing orange, so the “Huai” in northern part could not produce orange and therefore be abandoned.That's all.

Or so we thought. As luck would have it, this special tree may not have been able to produce oranges, but it was able to grow something far more valuable. The "Huai" tree was able to grow QQ's from its branches- white rice, fried rice and lo mein. It had enough QQ's to end world hunger. 

This ability made the tree very valuable. The town kept this a secret and over  the years became the most powerful city in China. As Yiqun's Hometown grew, so did its enemies. Slowly the secret was being spread accross the world and many countries were becoming envious of the tree.

Many countries made attempts to root up the tree and bring it to their country. Some attempts were crafty, with distractions and 'trojan horse' tactics. Others were very boring, such as a select few trying to just run into the town and cut the tree down. But in the end, all attempts made were easily thwarted by the people that were native to the town.

Then one day a man came to the town and yelled "Are you NOT ENTERTAINED?" as lo mein fell on his head. The man clearly had not been expecting this and cried out in anguish.  In that moment, the lo mein began to wrap around the man and grew into another tree.  It was in this moment the tree released its spores, in the form of peanut butter chicken which were quickly blown throughout the world.
